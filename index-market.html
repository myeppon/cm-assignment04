            <h2>MY KIND OF MARKET</h2> 
                <h1>FLOATING MARKET</h1>
                    <p>One might feel as though they are entering a different world upon visiting a Thai floating market. Slender canals are crammed with boats selling an abundance of food and goods, while friendly vendors talk amongst themselves in Thai. To me, it's a surreal experience I do not wish for anyone to miss while visiting the country.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Why canals? Before urban Bangkok was developed, the city was a jungle. The water was the only possible way for them to travel and sell their goods. Thais do not ignore the old ways of doing things as the canals remain a popular means of trade until today.</p>
