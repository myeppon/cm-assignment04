                <h1>MATCHA GREEN TEA ICE CREAM</h1>
                    <p>Matcha ice cream (抹茶アイス) is by far my favorite ice cream flavor. It's so authentic because it's not one of those flavors you can find anywhere. My best bet is to visit a Japanese restaurant hoping they would have it as one of their dessert options. It's unfortunate to see how the flavor is not so popular in the Western continent as it is in South East Asia. With that being said, I have not found a single ice cream place in Boulder where they sell matcha green tea ice cream.</p>
